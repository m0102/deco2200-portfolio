                <p>This is a design process journal I created for a university project conducted over 12 weeks, designing an interface for an autonomous tour bus. The brief was to conceptualise the interactions required to assist people in interacting with autonomous vehicles in the future. The project team consisted of three members working collaboratively to complete research of the context area, create concepts relating to the brief and developing these concepts to create a final interactive prototype of the solution. While we worked hard on this project, difficulties arose and were overcome, all contributing to, and influencing, our final design. The following is entries about the progression of our project and the process we underwent, documented on a week-by-week basis. </p>

                <p>This week our group discussed the design brief and brainstormed directions we wanted to explore for our project. We wrote down all of our ideas and potential contexts and vehicles to discover the more interesting and undeveloped area that we all agreed on. We looked at contexts including education, household productivity, public streets, health, emergency services and entertainment. We also looked at different vehicles such as robots (e.g. Roomba), buses, trucks and wheelchairs. Within the contexts we saw many opportunities. These included school buses, trucks suppling goods, party buses, patient transport wheelchairs and household garbage disposal. We discarded most of them as they were already developed, too close to current products or too simple. We decided we didn’t want to explore cars as it was already being developed by large companies and that would limit our design opportunities. We realised we wanted the project to be creative and as original as possible, so we focused on lesser developed/known modes of autonomous transport.

                <p>Our group liked the ideas of the school bus and party bus the best, and so decided to focus on buses as our vehicle. We dismissed the party bus idea as we felt it was a low impact concept and would be limited in design. We instead focused on school buses and developed the concept to include a roll marking system, tracking, emergency response and communication with parents. We then brainstormed different situations to research in which this design idea would be useful including kids getting lost on excursions and falling asleep on the bus. We also understood there would be some issues with this idea, specifically child privacy laws related to tracking the students’ location. We realised that it would be difficult to obtain accurate research because we didn’t have access to this demographic.

                <p>This week we revisited the school bus concept, however we decided to take the project in a different direction. We didn’t think there was enough opportunity in the school context and wouldn’t be as creative or enjoyable. The lack of access to the target user (school children) also greatly influenced our decision as it would impact the depth and reliability of our research later on. We still liked the idea of autonomous buses however and brainstormed different areas to implement them. We looked back at the entertainment context as one of our previous ideas were tour guide vehicles which provided information, a voting system for where to go and alerts about good photo opportunities. We developed this and came up with tour buses and decided on it as we were excited about the opportunities in this area.

                <p> After doing a stakeholder map on the tour buses we realised that it was possible for us to research this area well, especially with travellers, international students or someone who’s been overseas because tourists were the main stakeholder in this business. We began to brainstorm how to contact our target users and our objective for our primary research, developing a research invitation to use to contact potential research participants.                 </p>

                <p> We decided our objective was to discover what their past experiences with tour buses has been like, what their ideas/improvements for the industry are and features they like on other transport systems or at tourist attractions. From this objective we developed interview questions broadly about interviewees experience being a tourist and on tour buses and what they thought could be improved. We then did a brainstorm of different research methods from Design, Think, Make, Break, Repeat and allocated them to try and get the largest range of data. These included observations, interviews, surveys, focus groups and scenarios. </p>              </div>

                <p>This week we worked on gathering primary research individually for our research reports. We had split up the methods and I had chosen interviews, observations and mind mapping. I began with a mind map to document my preconceived ideas about tour buses, the users and the users’ purpose. I used colour and icons to separate and combine different strains of ideas. My main insight while making it was the difference between private and public/hop-on hop-off buses and their uses, i.e. private buses were usually longer tours with groups, and some of them may chat or sleep while travelling long distances. In contrast, public were meant for short term trips in which people were always paying attention and taking photos or listening to audio. This gave me ideas about future contexts for our project, depending on the type of bus we chose.  </p>
                <p>I did observations at both Bondi Beach on the weekend and at Central mid-week after uni. I took photos and notes of peoples’ movements within the space, their emotions whilst using the service and trends among different users. I compared my research from both locations, noting similarities and differences between the data, including how many people there were, their interactions with the buses and their actions when they exited the bus. My primary insights were that most people were travelling in groups, either with friends or family, that the users gathered together for some time once they had left the bus, in order to gather their belongings and decide where to go next, and that while most users went towards the main attraction or location (i.e. either Bondi Beach or Central Station), some people went in other directions, exploring the shops or food establishments.  </p>
                <p>We realised after doing this research separately that each of us had done similar data collection, especially with interviews and observations. However, we understood that this was because it was the best source of primary data and efficient to complete. We decided this overlap was justified because it provided us with a larger data pool, including a wider demographic and more experiences. This created a more accurate representation of the information overall when we combined our research and extracted insights later on. </p>

                <p> I also begun finding my participants and doing my interviews this week. I used the questions our group formulated in order to obtain the most relevant information for our project. I then did short interviews with them, probing beyond the initial questions depending on their answers. I recorded the interviews, so I could transcribe them later to keep the tone more conversational and keep the focus on their answers. The interviewees I chose reflected our target users, mostly young adults who have been tourists previously or used a tour service. The interviews revealed lots of interesting information.

                <p>I was most surprised by the fact that most of the subjects preferred a knowledgeable tour guide over a pre-recorded tour and were quite passionate about it. I thought that in this digital age the users would favour an app or technology over a real person, however the guide made the tour entertaining and created a memorable experience. The interviewees also confirmed what I thought about scheduling which was that it was too rigid and structured. Most people preferred to have some free time or the ability to explore by themselves.

                <p>The Big Bus Tours were informative as that’s the service I did my observations of. I had done previous research before my observations, such as on the two different routes (the City and Bondi route) and bus times. Upon further research I found that they had an app already, that they collaborated with attractions including the zoo (for day passes), and that the Hop-on Hop-off service only provided the bus/route and audio, allowing users freedom to explore individually. This related to information I had learned from my interviews and observations, however not many people had used this service themselves. The system was very different from the group, structured tours most people had experienced which furthered my research.  I also discovered that autonomous buses were being tested worldwide, including the RAC Intellibus in Perth. This bus, as with most current designs, are shuttle buses with limited passengers and a smaller vehicle size. While the buses aim to reduce human error and crashes, the technology needs advancements before it’s ready to replace self-driven buses.
                </p>

                <p> I created a storyboard to represent one of my persona’s potential experiences on a tour bus, based on my interviews. It highlighted positive and negative aspects of her experiences to visualise the journey and identify pain points. I synthesised this data in the form of key insights and an affinity diagram. The main user needs regarding bus tours that arose from my synthesis were flexibility, customisation and uniqueness. </p>

                <p>This week our group combined all of our research data to find the most common trends and opportunity areas, as well as any design ideas we already had about different aspects of the buses. We came up with a list of user needs that were consistent across all of our research. These included flexibility, authenticity and personalisation. We decided to focus on implementing an interactive system in an autonomous ‘hop-on hop-off’ bus, rather than a private bus. This was because we had each done observations and other research about this company and style of bus and we saw the most interesting opportunities for design.

                <p>We then started exploring basic concepts for our next assignment. We brainstormed many concepts including an AI ‘Tour Buddy’ who is a personal tour guide; a ‘Choose-Your-Own-Adventure’ tour with suggestions and choices of location; a tour guide preference, or choice of different tours (e.g. historical or kid friendly); and following an icon’s journey around the area with different routes, and stories of their lives and journey.  </p>
                <p> We decided on two concepts. One was the ‘Choose-Your-Own-Adventure’ which we developed slightly further so users would be greeted as they entered the bus and choose locations to personalise their journey, creating a digital picture book with their adventure in it as a souvenir. The idea was to make the journey unique and personalised as we found it was a prevalent user need from our research. The second concept was the ‘Tour Buddy’ which we evolved into a personal tour guide that could interact with the individual users (each had their own ‘buddy’) and create a unique and personal experience for them. </p>
